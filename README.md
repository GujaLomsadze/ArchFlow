### ArchFlow (Architecture Flow)

### Tool for a Data Architecture Stress-Test and Dataflow Simulation using ABMs (Agent Based Modeling)

1) Why this Font and logo?
    - If you leave it ON, your device will drip a molten metal (Specially if your device has a plastic parts)

2) Why this project?
    - Master's Thesis.

   ```text
    "Markov Chain-Enhanced Integrated ABM (Agent Based Modeling)
    for Predictive Scaling, Bottleneck/edge-case detection in
    Distributed (BigData) Systems (Microservice Architectures)."
    ```

#### Goal of this project basically here is to prove that mathematical analysis of an architecture is important (?!), rather then relying on a Solutions Architect's or someone's 6'th sense

### List of Current Features
- Simulation of Markovian random walk through a graph
- Scalability Analysis
- Identifying scalability needs
- Predicting Bottlenecks (Kind of)
- Predicting System Failures
- Visual Analytics Dashboard for data flow

P.S <br>
Scalability includes:
    Disk, CPU, RAM, IOPS, TPS, QPS, RPS

### List of features I'm planning to add
- Easier configuration of a network topology
